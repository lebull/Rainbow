This repository is partly a personal research project/info dump, and partly an attempt to design and build a computer using vintage or uncommon technologies.

## A software guy's attempt at hardware

Being a web developer, I feel like I have lived my entire life on top of an enormous stack of software, most of which I'm not even aware of.  Wouldn't it be nice to spend some time with a machine where I am in full control of every bit and every wire?

Probably not.

Over the past few months, I have found myself with a mild obsession over vintage hardware.

In a half-hearted attempt to "learn more" and get to play with a bunch of soldering irons, I've decided to gather everything to gather these techniques into a single project.

I'm not going to lie, I will be happy just to get any of these pieces even halfway working.

# Goals

### Priority
* Design and create a system to display my guest wifi sid/password
* Data stored in hand-made rope memory Memory

### Secondary

* Interchangable/Editable inputs (even if it means a little work)

### Stretch

* System is a working computer with the following
  * Permanent and/or switchable rope memory modules
  * Ferrite Random Access Memory, either purchased or handmade
  * Rudimentary Operating System
    * Task Management
    * Memory Diagnostic and aware of INOP bits
    * Input interfacing

* Tetris, or some playable game


# Hardware Description

### Read Only Memory

In the form of Rope Memory.

I am interested in being able to easily swap out ropes

### Random Access Memory

In the form of Magnetic Core Memory

### CPU

Not sure aobut this one yet.  Probably FPGA based

### Operating System

No idea yet

### Output

Probably some sort of led matrix, but I'm not committed to it yet.
