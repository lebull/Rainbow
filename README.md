This repository is partly a personal research project/info dump, and partly an attempt to design and build a computer using vintage or uncommon technologies.

## A software guy's attempt at hardware

Being a web developer, I feel like I have lived my entire life on top of an enormous stack of software, most of which I'm not even aware of.

Over the past few months, I have found myself with a mild obsession over vintage hardware.

In a half-hearted attempt to "learn more" and get to play with a bunch of soldering irons, I've decided to gather everything to gather these techniques into a single project.

I'm not going to lie, I will be happy just to get any of these pieces even halfway working.
